I also realized that I didn’t feel particularly fulfilled by or proud of what I had built. Then the recession hit, and everything changed overnight. I closed my business and moved to New York City while I figured out what to do next.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During this time, I explored a few different business opportunities. My interests gravitated toward science, technology and the environment. The tech industry was really taking off at that point, and I was incredibly inspired by this new technology-powered world where anything felt possible. It was the opposite of how I’d felt working in fashion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2008, I started to think about how I could combine all of my different interests. While working on a shoe collection, I visited a large manufacturing city in China and was shocked by what I saw. The smog was so thick that I couldn’t see beyond one city block. I became short of breath and started to cough after a short walk. The waterways I passed were brown and sludge-filled, but I still saw rice farmers working on the banks of them.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As I began to ask questions, I discovered that fashion and textiles were a dominant industry in the region. I understood for the first time, in a very real way, the connection between fashion and the environment. The clothes that filled my closet were responsible for this horrible pollution.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I came home from China, I started doing my research and learned that, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an article in the journal Natural Science</a>, more than 8,000 different chemicals—including formaldehyde, chlorine, lead and mercury—are used in textile processing and dying. The same article notes that The World Bank estimates that about a fifth of industrial water pollution across the world comes from the treatment and dyeing of textiles. One of the most surprising things I learned was that cotton is one of the worst textile crops for the environment, yet it’s used to make about half of the clothing and other textiles worldwide, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the World Wildlife Fund</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joy Mangano on How to Forge Your Own Path to Success</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It doesn’t stop there. Cotton is extremely water-intensive: A single T-shirt requires about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2,700 liters of water</a>, or more than 700 gallons, to make. So the industry-wide impact multiplies quickly. Switching to synthetic fibers isn’t the answer since they require chemical treatments during processing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the National Resources Defense Council</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Let’s get a few additional facts straight, as well: I eat cheeseburgers, I wear leather and I sleep on cotton sheets. As a consumer, I can rationalize these transgressions as minimal in the grand scheme of things. Also, what am I supposed to do if there are no comparable alternatives? I don’t like veggie burgers, fake leather or polyester sheets. What I can’t rationalize is being a part of a business that produces tens of thousands of dresses a month in China that are hurting the world we live in. Once I realized the scope of the impact that my industry’s production has on the environment, I knew I had to make a change.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Kors Explains His Philosophy on Fashion Uniforms</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then something clicked, and I realized I could build a sustainable fashion brand. My vision for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reformation</a> was simple: Create a brand where fashion and sustainability coexist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To make Reformation clothing, we use sustainable fabrics, repurposed vintage clothing and rescued fabric from fashion houses that have over-ordered. Our office in Los Angeles also sources electricity from 100% renewable power suppliers, and we use LED lighting and Energy Star-rated appliances. We pay attention to every detail and do what we can to improve every day.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6 TED Talks That Will Boost Your Creativity</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The other big piece of my approach has been educating the consumer. It’s not only our job to provide beautiful, limited-edition clothing to women around the world, but also to let our consumers know how much power they can have in the fight against traditional fashion practices.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I hope that, moving forward, sustainability isn’t seen as an added bonus for companies. It should just be the standard.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Yael Aflalo is the CEO and founder of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reformation</a>, a lifestyle brand that utilizes sustainable fabrics and practices to create cool and feminine collections that are eco-conscious.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtamZpgHp%2BjqysrKyRnruirsueZJykn6m1qrrGZqmenp%2BnuqLAyKilaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./singer-teni-laments-over-lack-of-beef-among-female-singers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Singer Teni laments over lack of beef among female singers">&larr;
