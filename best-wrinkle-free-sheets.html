While ironing your sheets is a foolproof way to smooth them, who has that kind of time? Since we can’t all escape to a hotel for the weekend when our sheets are unsightly, there’s just one option remaining for those who crave a smooth surface to sleep on: wrinkle-free sheets.</p><p>In search of the best wrinkle-free sheets available, I tested a variety of them, both those advertised as wrinkle-free, along with ones that reviewers rate highly for their smooth, wrinkle-free appearance. Read on for my top choices on the best wrinkle-free bed sheets.</p><h2 id=our-top-wrinkle-free-sheet-picks>Our top wrinkle-free sheet picks</h2><h3>Best wrinkle-free cotton sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nest Sateen Organic Cotton Sheet Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wrinkle-free cotton sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Nest Sateen Organic Cotton Sheet Set</h3></p><p>Soft, smooth, and cool to the touch, these Nest organic cotton sheets are naturally wrinkle-resistant due to their sateen weave, and reviewers agree that they stay remarkably smooth compared to other cotton bed sheets. They come in a dazzling variety of color options, like Moss, Pewter, and Terracotta. They’re also responsibly produced in India with certified organic and fair trade cotton that softens with washing. (Shopping tip: Nest also makes some of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best pillows</a> that have adjustable fill and a 30-night trial.)</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% certified organic cotton</li><li>Thread count: 300</li><li>Weave: Sateen</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King&nbsp;</li><li>Care: Wash cold, tumble dry low</li><li>Price: $62 - $93</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Certified organic and fair trade cotton</li><li>Materials are sourced responsibly in India</li><li>Pillowcases have an internal sleeve to hold pillows in place</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Made from high quality, responsibly-sourced materials, these 100% <a rel=alternate href=#>organic sheets</a> are also wrinkle-resistant.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nest Sateen Organic Cotton Sheet Set</a></p><h3>Best wrinkle-free percale sheets: Lands’ End 300 Thread Count Premium Supima Cotton Percale Bed Sheet Set</h3><p>Editor’s note: Since testing, Lands’ End has discontinued the 300-thread count premium Supima&nbsp; cotton percale bed sheet set; but Lands’ End has released a similar set, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lands’ End 400 Thread Count Premium Supima Cotton Percale Bed Sheet Set</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span class=best-for>Best wrinkle-free percale sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>400 Thread Count Premium Supima Cotton No Iron Sateen Bed Sheet Set - Lands' End - Ivory - SK</h3></p><p>With hundreds of 4-star reviews and ratings, I had high expectations for these Lands’ End Supima cotton percale sheets—and they did not disappoint. Supima cotton is American-made, and is twice as strong as regular cotton. Some reviewers mention that these sheets are too thin for them; for me, their thin quality is a bonus, as it makes the sheets feel more soft, supple, and silky to the touch.&nbsp;</p><p>Sliding into them, they feel cool and crisp, and best of all, they’re remarkably wrinkle-resistant, even after multiple nights' sleep. Although the color options are limited, I found the Pale Flax that my set came in to be elegant and calming. After washing they remained satisfyingly wrinkle-resistant, losing a bit of crispness but trading it for softness.

Not only is eucalyptus bedding soft and somewhat silky in texture, offering a more affordable alternative to real silk sheets, but it’s also naturally wrinkle-resistant. Tencel is made from nanofibrils, which are tiny fibers that are super strong and moisture absorbent. This makes them less prone to wrinkling, and also offers a cooler sleep experience.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Organic tencel and Egyptian cotton</li><li>Thread count: n/a</li><li>Weave: Single-ply percale weave</li><li>Sizes available: Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Care: Machine wash, gentle cycle, line dry or tumble dry low</li><li>Price: $84.99 - $90.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Made from material that’s naturally wrinkle-resistant&nbsp;</li><li>OEKO-TEX® certified</li><li>Hypoallergenic</li><li>Sleeps cool</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Only two color options: Light Grey and White</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re craving the soft, silky feel of eucalyptus sheets, these Sweave sheets are a great option and are naturally wrinkle resistant.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sweave Eucalyptus Tencel Sheet Set</a></p><h3>Best microfiber wrinkle-free sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>SONORO KATE Bed Sheet Set Super Soft Microfiber</a>&nbsp;</h3><p><span class=best-for>Best microfiber wrinkle-free sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>SONORO KATE Bed Sheet Set Super Soft Microfiber 1800 Thread Count Luxury Egyptian Sheets 16-Inch Deep Pocket，Wrinkle and Hypoallergenic-4 Piece (Spa Blue, Queen)</h3></p><p>Offered in eighteen different colors—including Sage, Coral, and Spa Blue—and multiple size options including Twin XL and California King, these microfiber, wrinkle-resistant sheets provide a wealth of choices at an ultra low price point. Microfiber, typically made from polyester blends, tends to be soft and wrinkle-resistant by design, and with over 100K 5-star ratings, these sheets are top of the list for wrinkle-resistant microfiber bedding.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% brushed microfiber</li><li>Thread count: 1800</li><li>Weave: n/a</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Full XL, Queen, King, Cal King&nbsp;</li><li>Care: Machine wash, tumble dry</li><li>Price: $29.90 - $42.90</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Ultra soft</li><li>Microfiber is naturally wrinkle-free</li><li>Comes in 18 different bright and fun color options</li><li>Flexible returns</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Color starts to fade after several washes</li><li>Some reviewers feel the sheets are too thin</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These soft, colorful microfiber sheets are not only budget-friendly, they’re also naturally wrinkle-free!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>SONORO KATE Bed Sheet Set Super Soft Microfiber</a></p><h3>Best budget wrinkle-free sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>lalaLOOM Microfiber Bed Sheets</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget wrinkle-free sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>lalaLOOM Queen Bed Sheet Set, Soft Microfiber Hotel Luxury Bedding, Extra Deep Pocket, 4 Piece Sheets and Pillowcase Sets, Breathable Wrinkle, Fade Resistant Easy Care Machine Washable Linen Navy Blue</h3></p><p>If you’re sticking to a strict budget but still want soft, comfortable sheets that stay wrinkle-resistant, lalaLOOM has a great option with this soft microfiber sheet set. The sheets feel like soft cotton, and while they did show some wrinkles after washing, they remained reasonably smooth overall. They’re offered in a nice variety of colors, and the Navy Blue, which I chose, was a beautiful vibrant hue.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Polyester, microfiber</li><li>Thread count: n/a</li><li>Weave: n/a</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King</li><li>Care: Machine wash</li><li>Price: $16.99 - $34.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Offered in a wide range of color options</li><li>Hypoallergenic</li><li>Soft feel at a budget price</li><li>OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Showed some wrinkles</li><li>Feels like budget sheets</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Sturdy, serviceable sheets at a low price, with a low wrinkle quotient.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>lalaLOOM Microfiber Bed Sheets</a></p><h3>Best splurge wrinkle-free sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge wrinkle-free sheets</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bamboo Viscose Sheet Set in Terra (Size: Split King) - Cozy Earth</h3></p><p>These sheets provide a magical experience before they even hit your mattress. They arrive packaged in an adorable tote bag, and upon removing the sheets I was immediately struck at their luxurious silkiness. They’re made from bamboo, which is known to be naturally cooling and naturally wrinkle-resistant, and these sheets are a perfect example of both. From the minute I laid down on them, I noticed how cool they were to the touch—much more so than typical cotton sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>They did arrive slightly wrinkled, which is natural since they were folded. After washing, they showed some significant wrinkles even though I folded them directly out of the laundry, so line-drying may be the simplest way to keep these sheets completely smooth without having to iron them. I chose the Walnut color (listed as Brown on the website), and the color is gorgeous, with a lot of depth and a subtle green tint. If you’re ready to spend top dollar for the highest-quality sheets, Cozy Earth Bamboo is an excellent and elegant choice.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sweavebedding.com/cdn/shop/files/productimage03oekotex_2.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/2492a7f1354042c267ad982cc26f356c/a15fd/cozy-earth-bamboo-sheet-2.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Viscose from bamboo</li><li>Thread count: n/a</li><li>Weave: n/a</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King</li><li>Care: Machine wash cold, tumble dry</li><li>Price: $270 - $375</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Luxurious, silky feel</li><li>Gentle on sensitive skin</li><li>Naturally cooling</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Very pricey</li><li>Some reviews say the sheets fall apart quickly, though we didn’t have that experience</li><li>Did show significant wrinkles after washing</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re looking for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bamboo sheets</a> available and you’re read to splurge, these sheets are well worth the price when it comes to comfort and style—but they aren’t 100% wrinkle-free.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set</a></p><h3>Best sateen wrinkle-free sheets: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Company Store Classic Smooth Wrinkle-Free Sateen Sheet Set</a></h3><p>At first touch, these sheets feel thick and substantial, and soft but not silky. They arrived remarkably unwrinkled, and after washing they did show a few wrinkles, but wrinkling was moderate. They have a 300 thread count and feel cool to the touch when you first lay down, however because of their thickness they’re very insulating, and can tend to heat up through the course of the night. Therefore, they’re recommended for cold sleepers and chilly climates. They felt crisp and comfortable to sleep on, with a pleasing weight to them, much like the sheets you might find at an upscale hotel. They’re offered in eleven dazzling colors, including Blue Sapphire, Caramel, Mulberry, and many others. They’re also OEKO-TEX® certified, which definitely helped me sink into sleep on these sheets with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/38518a52f8cfddb5f1749cb0d8b21eed/a15fd/cozy-earth-bamboo-sheet.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/350e9b9fa403fab04d2a817bc6a149cf/52bdc/the-company-store-1.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: 100% combed cotton sateen</li><li>Thread count: 300 thread count</li><li>Weave: Sateen</li><li>Sizes available: Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King</li><li>Care: Machine washable</li><li>Price: $134 - $229</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Numerous exciting color options</li><li>Sheets feel substantial yet soft</li><li>OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 certified</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Hot sleepers may find that these sheets retain heat due to their thickness</li><li>On the more expensive side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>For high quality, thick cotton sateen sheets that won’t wrinkle up, these Company Store wrinkle-free sateen sheets are recommended.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Company Store Classic Smooth Wrinkle-Free Sateen Sheet Set</a></p><h3>Best wrinkle-free sheets with size options: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Royal Hotel 650 Thread Count Wrinkle-Free Bed Sheets</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wrinkle-free sheets with size options</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Royal Hotel Bedding 650-Thread-Count Bed Sheets - Wrinkle Free Sheets - Deep Pocket, Cotton Blend, Sateen Sheets, Hypoallergenic, 4 Piece - Queen - Gold, Striped</h3></p><p>I was excited to experience the feel of 650 thread count sheets and these did not disappoint—they feel silky soft and luxurious to the touch. They’re comfortable to sleep on and lightweight. They arrived creased but mostly wrinkle-free. After sleeping on them for a few nights they were a bit more wrinkled, and after washing they did show a few wrinkles, but remained reasonably smooth. They’re a blend of 70% cotton and 30% polyester, which gives them more elasticity than you might find with 100% cotton. These sheets come in a wide array of attractive colors and patterns, and they even include extra elastic bands for fitting around mattresses up to 18” deep. Best of all, they’re offered in sixteen different size options, including hard-to-find sizes like Super Queen, King Waterbed, and more.&nbsp;</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/5d3604bc6360cc7b40f4582987490a41/52bdc/the-company-store-2.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/9ca8cff989dcf24270ce65cdf4becade/52bdc/royal-hotel-650.jpg></span></span><p>Jessamyn Ansary / Content Writer</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Materials: Cotton and polyester blend</li><li>Thread count: 650</li><li>Weave: Sateen</li><li>Sizes available: 16 different sizes from Twin to Split Cal King</li><li>Care: Machine wash cold, tumble dry low</li><li>Price: $66.49 - $104.49</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Vast range of hard-to-find size options available</li><li>650 thread count feels luxurious</li><li>Offered in a variety of colors and patterns</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Shows some wrinkles, especially after washing</li><li>On the expensive side</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re looking for wrinkle-resistant sheets in an unusual size, these have you covered, and they’re also crafted from high quality cotton sateen.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Royal Hotel 650 Thread Count Wrinkle-Free Bed Sheets</a></p><h2 id=how-did-we-select-the-best-wrinkle-free-sheets>How did we select the best wrinkle-free sheets?</h2><p>To select the best ones, I sleep-tested numerous wrinkle-free sheet sets—before and after the first wash—to see how the wrinkle-free claims hold up over time. I also scoured reviews to find the top wrinkle-free sheets on the market, then used that research to create a list of top selections to guide my research and to test claims. In addition to sleeping on the sheet sets, I also washed them to see how they performed after typical laundry treatments.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-wrinkle-free-sheets>What to consider when buying wrinkle-free sheets</h2><p>If you’re looking for sheets that are not only wrinkle-free, but also comfortable and stylish, the options can be overwhelming. Here are some of the most important factors to consider when searching for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bed sheets</a> available on the market.</p><h3>Consider the material</h3><p>Perhaps the most important factor in choosing any sheet set is selecting the right material for your particular needs. (Materials affect thread count and you can learn more about that in our guide on the <a rel=alternate href=#>best thread count for sheets</a>.) Some materials, like eucalyptus and bamboo, are naturally cooling and breathable, with a silkier texture, while other types of materials, like cotton, are known for being more crisp to the touch, and tend to get softer with each wash. So, if your priority is to find the <a rel=alternate href=#>best cooling sheet</a> that’s also wrinkle-resistant, you might focus your search on eucalyptus and bamboo. But if you prefer the crisp feel of cotton, yet still want a wrinkle-free experience, read on for our next consideration: the weave.</p><h3>Consider the weave</h3><p>The weave refers to the way the actual fibers are constructed in your bedding. Some of the most common weaves are percale, sateen, twill, and jersey. A sateen weave on a cotton sheet will typically make the sheet more soft and supple, which can reduce the appearance of wrinkles, while a percale weave will give you more strength and durability. Twill is also known for durability, but it’s often flagged as less comfortable than other weaves. A jersey weave, on the other hand, is known for its stretch and softness.</p><h3>Naturally wrinkle-free vs. chemically treated</h3><p>When shopping for wrinkle-free sheets, keep an eye out for sheets that have been treated with chemicals like formaldehyde—these chemicals can temporarily keep sheets smooth, but they can also be harmful to your health. Instead, opt for sheets made of naturally wrinkle-resistant fabrics, like eucalyptus, wool, or microfiber. You can also keep an eye out for quality certifications, like <a rel=nofollow href=#>OEKO-TEX</a>®, which means products have been tested for a list of up to 350 harmful chemicals.</p><p>If your sheets are constantly emerging from your dryer wrinkled like an accordion, the culprit may be an overstuffed dryer. When your dryer is overfull, your sheets won’t dry evenly, which can lead to wrinkling. To fix this issue, simply fill up your machine halfway with bedsheets, or at most three-fourths of the way full. This will allow them to move around while drying, which will lead to a more even drying process and less wrinkles.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the best material for sheets to not wrinkle?</h3><p>If you’re looking to avoid chemicals in your bedding while still keeping your sleep surface smooth, then you’ll want to look for materials that are naturally wrinkle-resistant. Eucalyptus sheets are a great choice, as they’re not only naturally wrinkle-resistant, they also have a silky texture and are naturally breathable and cooling. Microfiber, made from combed polyester, is another material that tends to be wrinkle-resistant by nature.</p><h3>What sheets are less likely to wrinkle?</h3><p>Sheets are less likely to wrinkle if they’re made from wrinkle-resistant fabrics or materials, like eucalyptus, bamboo, microfiber, or sheets with a sateen weave. Sheets may also be less likely to wrinkle if they have been treated with wrinkle-resistant chemicals.&nbsp;</p><h3>Do dryer sheets actually prevent wrinkles?</h3><p>They can! Dryer sheets are squares of fabric soaked in fabric softener. As the dryer heats up, the fabric softener is released onto your clothing. This not only helps your clothes (and sheets) smell fresh, it can also reduce static, leading to less wrinkling.</p><h3>How often should you wash your sheets?</h3><p>Washing your sheets every two weeks or so is standard practice, and will help prevent buildup of dust and bacteria. But if you find that your sheets are unsightly or wrinkled after one week, then washing them weekly might be your best bet. To learn more on this topic, read our guide to <a rel=alternate href=#>how often you should wash your sheets</a>.</p><h3>How do you unwrinkle sheets quickly?</h3><p>The best and quickest way to smooth a wrinkled sheet is to iron it. But if you don’t have time for that, there are a few other tricks you can try. One method is to take your bedding out of the dryer several times during the dry cycle to shake it, which helps keep wrinkles at bay during the drying process. Another trick is to pull the fitted sheet taut on your mattress and mist it lightly with water from a spray bottle. As the water dries, the sheet will already be in a flat, smooth position, so it will be more likely to dry smooth and wrinkle-free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp6e2r7fLnmSfqpWaerS0xJ6rrGc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./court-of-appeal-debunks-justice-ugos-reported-resignation-from-pepc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Court of Appeal debunks Justice Ugo's reported resignation from PEPC">&larr;
