In&nbsp;this article there are very different stories: about greed, honesty, naivety, loneliness, recklessness and conscience.</p><p>At&nbsp;the very end, we&nbsp;will tell you about why rich people actually need their wealth. No, not for the sake of&nbsp;ticking boxes or&nbsp;constantly increasing their wealth. And not even for the sake of&nbsp;buying fancy things.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;once knew a&nbsp;very interesting man. He&nbsp;paid me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money for just sleeping in&nbsp;the same bed with him. I&nbsp;had the keys to&nbsp;his apartment. I&nbsp;would come to&nbsp;his place, change into my&nbsp;pajamas, get into bed and fall asleep. He&nbsp;would come over later and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed too.<br>We&nbsp;had no&nbsp;relationship at&nbsp;all.

There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;way to&nbsp;tell. When I&nbsp;met him, I&nbsp;was immediately attracted to&nbsp;his incredible sense of&nbsp;humor and intellect. He&nbsp;was dressed very modestly (I&nbsp;did not even notice his watch because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not flashy; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;$60,000&nbsp;watch).<br>We&nbsp;went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;few dates before&nbsp;I visited his home, which is&nbsp;not opulent by&nbsp;any stretch of&nbsp;the imagination. I&nbsp;even treated him to&nbsp;dinner a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times. He&nbsp;drives a&nbsp;SmartCar in&nbsp;Paris (where he&nbsp;lives most of&nbsp;the year). When he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the States, he&nbsp;shops at&nbsp;Ross, and other discount stores, and always goes on&nbsp;the day that he&nbsp;gets a&nbsp;senior discount.<br>He&nbsp;loves coupons, and when&nbsp;I show him ways to&nbsp;save extra money. He&nbsp;proudly wears a&nbsp;bracelet that&nbsp;I got him on&nbsp;sale for $160. On&nbsp;the other hand, he&nbsp;always flies either business or&nbsp;first class; owns over 100 properties in&nbsp;London, Paris and Miami; has houses in&nbsp;those three cities, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cannes; owns a&nbsp;yacht.<br>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;decent, honest and down-to-earth man who treats everyone with dignity and <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>, and gives much back to&nbsp;his <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;time and money. He&nbsp;brags about me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;career and&nbsp;I own my&nbsp;own home, and greatly admires my&nbsp;intellect and thoughtfulness.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Anonymous&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c8/480/f0bb4e55c2888b4b24be9538eb.jpg><ul><li>My&nbsp;husband’s best friend leads a&nbsp;reclusive lifestyle.

He&nbsp;breeds fish in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pond. He&nbsp;rarely goes out in&nbsp;public, he&nbsp;lives alone.<br>He&nbsp;came to&nbsp;our wedding anniversary, and&nbsp;I don’t know why&nbsp;I told my&nbsp;friends about him. Then the guests watched as&nbsp;4&nbsp;women circled the man, who sat alone at&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate table. He&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with it&nbsp;for about an&nbsp;hour and then left.

The property was absolutely massive with private beach and all but easily explained as&nbsp;it&nbsp;had been in&nbsp;the family for generations.<br>I&nbsp;love cooking and was asked to&nbsp;prepare dinner for everyone on&nbsp;the third night of&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;make, I&nbsp;was told to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;grocery list of&nbsp;whatever I&nbsp;wanted. Being on&nbsp;the coast and all, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;make some whole cod with some family style sides. I&nbsp;thought they were just being nice and going grocery shopping, since&nbsp;I was not <a href=# title=familiar data-link=tag>familiar</a> at&nbsp;all with the area.<br>The moment&nbsp;I knew these people weren’t just well off but wealthy was when the aunt placed a&nbsp;phone call and 3&nbsp;hours later a&nbsp;seaplane landed at&nbsp;their dock with produce picked that day and then a&nbsp;boat pulled up&nbsp;with the cod&nbsp;I asked for.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;PlentyLettuce&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d7a/fd3/7e39b256f58bd35798fe27c2d5.png><ul><li>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very rich friend who always had a&nbsp;few girlfriends at&nbsp;the same time.

He&nbsp;gave her his credit card and said, “Buy whatever you want.” Now I&nbsp;quote, “This silly girl bought a&nbsp;book and a&nbsp;juicer and gave me&nbsp;the card back.” At&nbsp;that moment, he&nbsp;realized that she was the one.

He&nbsp;started from scratch, came to&nbsp;a&nbsp;foreign country without a&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;his pockets. He’s never been involved in&nbsp;any dark stories, he&nbsp;spends all his free time with his family.<br>And how much it&nbsp;pisses me&nbsp;off that people who have never bothered to&nbsp;get their butt off the sofa think that wealthy people are all thieves or&nbsp;criminals.

Her father is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very rich man. He&nbsp;was divorced from her mother, but he&nbsp;supported both of&nbsp;them, gave them branded clothes, bought them a&nbsp;car, and paid for trips.

Afterward I&nbsp;was told about their wealth and&nbsp;I realized that their clothes were bespoke. Everything fit like a&nbsp;glove. Their nails were perfectly manicured. The wife was not wearing normal jewelry.<br>They insisted on&nbsp;picking up&nbsp;the bill. They tipped $100&nbsp;on a&nbsp;$180&nbsp;receipt.

It’s why the most popular car among millionaires is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pickup truck and not Mercedes/BMW/etc.<br>For every insecure egomaniac living the lifestyle of&nbsp;the rich and shameless, there are a&nbsp;dozen living quietly&nbsp;— or&nbsp;what the late Thomas Stanley called “The millionaire next door.” The quiet millionaires typically live a&nbsp;slightly upper middle class lifestyle.<br>They have nice homes, but not mansions. They are more likely to&nbsp;drive Hondas, Subarus, Volvos, Jeep Grand Cherokees, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Ford F150. They shop at&nbsp;Costco, and Target.

We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;stay out of&nbsp;it&nbsp;— he’ll play at&nbsp;love, and he’ll come round. It’s happened before.<br>But recently we&nbsp;learned that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;rewriting all the property on&nbsp;her, so&nbsp;that the children didn’t get anything. And he&nbsp;genuinely doesn’t see what’s going&nbsp;on. He&nbsp;thinks it’s true love.

It’s my&nbsp;choice.<br>I&nbsp;indulge myself whenever and in&nbsp;whatever way I&nbsp;want. I&nbsp;don’t gamble because there’s no&nbsp;thrill in&nbsp;it&nbsp;for&nbsp;me. Luxury cars to&nbsp;me&nbsp;are simply overpriced chunks of&nbsp;polished metal, plastic, leather, and wood.<br>Designer clothing? Who cares. Women?
