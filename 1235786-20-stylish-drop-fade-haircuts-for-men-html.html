Cornrow style</h3><p class=align-left>The fade styles can be combined with cornrow braids, and it is awesome because you will have a two-in-one hairstyle.</p><h2>What is a drop fade?</h2><p class=align-left>A drop fade cut bears a lot of similarities to a regular fade haircut. However, the difference is that it becomes lower around the front hairline and at the back of a person's head. The reason why it has some benefits compared to the sisterly style is the sharpness when it comes to outlining the face and some more depth in the crown area. Drop fade is a universal hairstyle which works together with plenty of bases, from the pompadour to afro. It can make everything more fresh and creative, that is why men from all around the world fancy it so much.</p><h3>Types of the drop fade</h3><p class=align-left>There are some usual types of drop fade that we will talk about today. For instance:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7777cf204a8810c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best new braid hairstyles for your lovely look</span></p></a><ul><li><strong>Low fade</strong> – this style begins above the ears and then reaches from the hairline to the neck. Low drop fade is loved by professional businessmen who always need to look fresh and clean. You can recognise it when you see a faded style with low contrast.</li><li><strong>Medium drop fade</strong> – this haircut is a beautiful balance between the lower and higher cut, and in case you are hesitant to choose one of them, you can go for the medium. The mid fade haircut usually begins halfway up the sides and provides a person with a decent middle ground, which is neither too fancy nor too frequent. The medium fade haircut has a significant advantage – it works typically with every hairstyle, type and length.</li><li><strong>High top drop fade </strong>– this is the edgy cut which generally begins around the top of a person's head. The guys who enjoy contrasts and want to have a cool dude vibe to them usually go to a barber in hopes to get such haircut. It can be combined with many different popular styles.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short and protective natural hairstyles for beautiful African women</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is impossible to create two styles which will look exactly the same. Some of the known variations of this hairstyle which can be created with any of the above lengths are:</p><ul><li><strong>Drop skin fade</strong> – this type is also known as bald or zero fades. The special thing about it is the way the hair is shaved off. While some haircuts of the fade style have some hair on the sides of the head left, the skin one features shaving all the hair down to the skin. A lot of men like this style because it does not require plenty of maintenance and can stay in the same condition for a long time.</li><li><strong>Drop fade with part </strong>– this is the name of a hairstyle that has the central part of the hair separated from the fade with the straight shaved line. It is a popular choice among people because it depicts style, confidence and edginess.</li><li><strong>Drop fade undercut </strong>– this style is a combination of two popular ones, undercut and fade. Fashion lovers adore this one because it is cute and practical, and it includes the best features of both. It can also be combined with more hair options, for example, comb-over.</li><li><strong>Drop fade comb over</strong> – finally, we have the comb-over together with undercut and fade. The distinctive thing about this style is all of the hair being combed to one side, and along with transition, it looks incredibly hot.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f7dd1a5796263832.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Be trendy and choose the best haircut for a black man</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did you like these 20 fantastic drop fade styles that are a trend of this year?
