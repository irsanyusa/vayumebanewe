Cosgriff had hired Levine to determine how much an LA Lakers Basketball poster could be worth.</p><p class=align-left>However, Levine's eye was caught by a green and orange painting with a Jackson Pollock signature on it. This painting was just under another pile of art in the dusty garage.</p><p class=align-left>After this incident, Levine could not rest until he could prove that the painting was real. He hired a borderline hunt to prove the authenticity of the painting.</p><p class=align-left>Levine also hired a private investigator to learn more about Gordon's history.
