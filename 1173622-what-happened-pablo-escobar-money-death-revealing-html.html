He had accumulated his wealth by engaging illegal drug trade. He was considered one of the wealthiest criminals in history.</p><h3>How much would Pablo Escobar be worth today?</h3><p class=align-left>Pablo Escobar's highest net worth today would be around $70 billion. Escobar amassed a vast fortune through his notorious drug empire.</p><h3>How much did Pablo Escobar make per day?</h3><p class=align-left>It is alleged that Pablo received over $50 million in cash each day through his prohibited substance sales. His cartel, The Medellin Drug Cartel, was extremely powerful, and at its peak, it supplied about 80% of illegal substances in America. His cartel muggled 15 tonnes of illegal substances in the United States of America every day.</p><p class=align-left>Since the authorities were after him, he was always on the run.

At the height of its operations, the cartel raked in more than $70 million daily. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made about </a>$420 million every week from his illegal trade.</p><h3>What happened to Pablo Escobar's money?</h3><p class=align-left>After his demise, the Colombian government acquired a significant portion of the drug lord's money. The authorities also forced his family to sign over any liquid assets left behind. In addition, the government seized money that it could trace to his close associates.</p><p class=align-left>His rivals also acquired some of his money and assets. The Cali cartel and Los PEPES wanted payment for their involvement in taking down the kingpin. The two groups forced the family to sign over any liquid asset left by the government.

They desired to remain financially stable after the demise of their leader.</p><p class=align-left>The little remaining money is what his immediate family lived on after his death. The drug lord did not leave a specific amount of money for his children in case of demise. However, Roberto and Alba Marina, two of his siblings, had some access to his estate.</p><p class=align-left>After the children ran out of money to live on, his son Sebastian asked his aunt Alba to retrieve $60 million from a secret hiding place. Alba came back and said there was barely any money left. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sebastián claimed</a>his aunt stole the money.</p><p class=align-left>He further claimed his uncle Robert betrayed the family and wrote a book with false claims for personal gains. Due to security issues, the drug lord's immediate family moved across different countries.

The property featured a Spanish colonial house, airport, zoo, and kart-racing track.</p><p class=align-left>He had imported hippopotamuses from Africa. They have since reproduced, and a herd of them are still on the property. Today, Hacienda Nápoles is a theme park.</p><h4>La Catedral</h4><p class=align-left>When he was captured and arrested, the wealthy drug king negotiated with the authorities to build his prison instead of going to the regular ones. He lived like a king in the prison he constructed known as La Catedral.</p><p class=align-left>The property featured a bar, disco area for hosting wedding receptions, jacuzzi, sauna, waterfall, and billiards room. He also had a full-size dollhouse for when his <a href=#>daughter Manuela Escobar </a>would visit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/680761e45aa65233.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Andrew Tate’s girlfriend timeline: who has he dated over the years?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Interestingly, police officers were not allowed within 12 miles of his prison.

However, a group of Benedictines transformed it into a meditation site for people who wish to get a break from the city.</p><h4>La Manuela party mansion</h4><p class=align-left>The Escobar family used La Manuela as a vacation or party mansion. Pablo Escobar's mansion was constructed for five years, and the family spent ample time there.</p><p class=align-left>However, a rival cartel destroyed a large portion of it in 1993. Today, it is a tourist attraction site open to the public.</p><h4>Tulum house</h4><p class=align-left>The<a href=#> drug lord</a> also had a luxurious house in Tulum, Mexico. The property was also deserted for a while. In 2012, Lio Malca, a gallery owner and art collector, purchased it. Malca turned it into a boutique hotel called Casa Malca. The hotel features his art collections.</p><h4>Isla Grande house</h4><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f492515e291bf844.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 famous Florida rappers: from old school to new blood</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8202d04a2ddd3fa5.png><p class=align-left>The drug lord also owned a luxurious property on Island Grande in the Caribbean.

Today, the property is in a dilapidated state. It is half demolished and is home to wild animals.</p><h4>Miami house</h4><p class=align-left>Before his demise, the drug Lord owned a 6,500-square-foot mansion in Miami Beach. The luxurious home featured four bedrooms.</p><p class=align-left>The American government seized the property when he was still alive and sold it to another person. In 2016, its new owner, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Christian de Berdouare</a>, chose to demolish the house and replace it with one that met his needs.</p><p class=align-left>During the demolition process, de Berdouare found a metal safe.

He was awarded a $3,000 grant from the Colombian government for surrendering the money.</p><h3>Is Pablo Escobar's money still buried?</h3><p class=align-left>The drug lord was notorious for hiding stacks of cash in walls, beneath the floors, and in other hidden spaces. He did so when evading arrest, so his money is still being discovered.</p><p class=align-left>In 2020, news headlines indicated that Pablo's money was found inside a wall in one of his homes.
