He was born on 17 July 1973 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and is 50 years old as of 2023. Zuri was born to Patti and her ex-husband Armstead Edwards after they had been married for four years. He is a music producer and talent manager.</p><p class=align-left>After Armstead and Patti separated, Armstead stopped working as her manager. Zuri took over the role and has been his mother’s manager since. LaBelle stated that <a id=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/patti-labelle-not-scared-after-dwts-and-the-masked-singer/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they fight often</a>. However, she is confident that he always gives her the best advice and will never lead her astray because he’s her baby.</p><p class=align-left>Zuri is married to Lona Azami, and they have three children: Gia, Leyla and Zuri Jr. Their eldest daughter, Gia, was born on 3 March 2015. At just eight years of age, she has already been introduced to the <a href=#>world</a> of fashion, and her grandmother Patti considers her a <a id=https://www.essence.com/fashion/patti-labelle-granddaughter-gia-edwards-instagram/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">little stylish diva</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ad73d4790fbc8f3e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Billie Eilish’s boyfriend's list: who has the singer dated?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The couple’s second daughter, Leyla, was born on 15 September 2017. Leyla shares an Instagram account with Gia, but the account is private. Their youngest child, Zuri Jr., was born in December 2022. LaBelle is a proud grandmother and often shares photos of her grandchildren on social media.</p><h3>Dodd Stocker-Edwards</h3><p class=align-left>Dodd is LaBelle’s second son and her first adopted child. The <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1531382-isabel-gravitts-biography-age-birthday-movies-tv-shows/ href=#>American actress</a> adopted Dodd while she was still married to her ex-husband Armstead. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">works at </a>PUMP <a href=#>DOG</a> Performance Apparel in Philadelphia, which he re-founded. Besides his work life, little is known about Dodd as he maintains a low profile.</p><h3>Stanley Stocker-Edwards</h3><p class=align-left>Stanley is LaBelle’s second adopted son. However, like his brother Dodd, little is known about his background and early life before his adoption. He went to Harvard Law School and is a lawyer in Washington, D.C.

William is the songwriter’s nephew, and she adopted him after his mother, Patti’s younger sister Jacqueline Holte, died in 1989. He generally keeps a low profile, and little is known about his early life.</p><p class=align-left>After the 2020 United States presidential election, he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">embroiled in controversy</a>. A Republican politician, Dean Browning, posted a tweet saying he was a “black gay guy “ who preferred Trump over Obama. There was massive outrage online, and <a href=#>social media</a> users posited that he had forgotten to use his fake account, where he pretended to be someone else. He responded by saying he had accidentally posted the message, which was sent to him by a mystery man named Dan Purdy.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after, Holte posted a video saying Browning’s statement was true, confirming that he was Dan Purdy. However, social media users quickly traced his online footprint and found his true identity as William Holte. As the backlash reached LaBelle, she stated that although she disagreed with his political inclinations, he was her family, and <a id=https://thegrio.com/2020/12/17/labelle-holte-purdy-trump/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she loved him</a>.
