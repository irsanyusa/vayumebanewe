Hope these work for you and you are able to smoothen your ties with her. After all, there shouldn’t be competition within the home.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>Understand her feelings</h3></p><p>Instead of retaliating or fighting with her, you should first try to understand what is causing such a revolt. All women are emotional beings. Try to observe her behaviour and look out for the triggers that provoke her to behave so. Once you understand those, it will be easier to reach out to her.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Give her attention</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Jealousy arises from insecurity and the sudden fear of being replaced by someone who has just become a member of the family. She fears to become a mere spectator of her son’s life. You'll need to understand these insecurities of hers and give her attention. Regular phone calls and text messages will let her know she is on your mind. Occasional visits will also go a long way to smoothen your relationship.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Keep her involved in your family</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7e21ccfd-745d-43f1-b28c-bb6b55bed35f data-caption="10 signs your mother-in-law is jealous of you and how to deal with her"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/qHiktkpTURBXy8yZWE3Yjg0NTcxYzExYzZmNDc1YjczOTZkNDRhM2I4YS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAg_Cww></span><p>The man you have married is proof of her good upbringing. Make her feel special. Keep her involved in little things. Sometimes, ask her advice on parenting and home making. Ask her to share special recipes with you. These efforts of yours could win her over.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>Acknowledge the bond between her and her son</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The most important thing for a mother is her child’s love. Once she's assured of her son's love, accepting you becomes easier. Show her that your marriage isn’t going to hamper the mother-son relationship. Her doubts and fears will be gone. She will soon start appreciating your qualities.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>Help her with the transition</h3></p><p>You are not the only one whose life is changing here. Your mother-in-law is also going through a transition here. Everything in the family is going to change and she doesn’t know whether she can handle it. As a newlywed, everyone is going to be attentive to you and help you with whatever you need but there is no one to understand that your mother-in-law also needs comfort and security. This particular fact is ignored by most people which makes a perfect mother into a jealous mother-in-law.</p><p>You need to help her from the start so that she doesn’t see you as a threat and instead, sees you as her confidant.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>Give her surprises</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-4bb7a825-743d-4ae7-a276-7aa806f95ebe data-caption="10 signs your mother-in-law is jealous of you and how to deal with her"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/ztmktkpTURBXy9jMTdmMGQ3MjUwZGJmMzI4NmQ2ZGQ0MzE2OWJhMWZkYS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAh3Cww></span><p>Ask your husband or your father in law about the likes and dislikes of your mother-in-law.

She will see a side of you that she didn’t expect and will welcome you with open arms.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-27>Remember communication is key</h3></p><p>If you can’t understand your mother-in-law’s behaviour, talk it out. Have a deep conversation with her. Be polite so that she doesn’t retaliate with anger. Ask her why she is behaving like this and ask her what’s wrong.

Don’t complain to him about her. Just tell him some of the things that could be bothering you. Ask him to reach out to his mother and find the root cause in a friendly way. The son might be able to get through to his mother better than you and help end the war.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7kGlkrKGXo8Buxc6uqWaln6m1pr6MoqVmpJGseqq%2FjKOcmqSfqsBuu8VmsKitXZa7pXnHqK5mrJ9isaaty2auoqyYYrWmvo5xbm6smpfD</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2-chainz-coolio-and-11-other-unlikely-celebrity-cookbook-authors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2 Chainz, Coolio and 11 Other Unlikely Celebrity Cookbook Authors">&larr;
