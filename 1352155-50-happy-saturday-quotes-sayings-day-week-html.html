If your happiness depends on money, you will never be happy with yourself. Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the world belongs to you.</li><li>We have three roles here on earth: to learn, to love, and to live. When we stop learning, we start to stagnate and die. When we stop loving, we lose our sense of purpose and become self-centred. When we limit our living, we deny the world the benefits of our talents.</li><li>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Do not settle.</li><li>Good morning, happy weekend! May your day be filled with blessings like the sun lights the sky, and may you always have the courage to spread your wings.</li><li>I always did something I was a little uncertain about. I think that is how one grows. When there is that moment of uncertainty and you push through those moments, that is when you get a breakthrough.</li><li>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life–think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</li><li>Even when life gets hard, just remember that after the tiring week, Saturday comes as a blessing along with Sunday so that you can have the time of your life.</li><li>The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, then there will be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be.</li><li>You - yourself, not someone else - need to determine where you want to go and what you want to do in your life. And once you make that decision, you can begin mapping a plan to get there and focusing on that objective every single day.</li><li>Do not settle for average. Bring your best to the moment. Then, whether it fails or succeeds, at least you know you gave it all you had.</li><li>It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old. They grow old because they stop pursuing dreams. Happy weekend my friend!</li><li>Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.</li><li>We often avoid the things that we are afraid of because we think there will be dire consequences if we confront them. But the truly dire consequences in our lives come from avoiding things that we need to learn about or discover.</li><li>There are two types of people who will tell you that you cannot make a difference in this world: those who are afraid to try and those who are afraid you will succeed.</li><li>This weekend, you have to dance like there is nobody watching, love like you will never be hurt, sing like there is nobody listening, and live like it is heaven on earth.</li><li>If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters. Excellence is not an exception, it is a prevailing attitude.</li><li>Enter every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of defeat. Concentrate on your strengths, instead of your weaknesses. Focus more on your powers instead of your problems.</li><li>The quality of a person’s life is in direct proportion to their commitment to excellence, regardless of their chosen field of endeavour.</li><li>Everyone has inside them a piece of good news. The good news is that you do not know how great you can be, how much you can love, what you can accomplish, and what your potential is.</li><li>An invincible determination can accomplish almost anything, and in this lies the great distinction between great men and little men.</li><li>Do not quit yet, the worst moments are usually followed by the most beautiful silver linings. You have to stay strong, remember to keep your head up and remain hopeful. Happy Saturday!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4bf88a8264fe9cee.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ amazing happy Wednesday quotes and messages to get you through hump day</span></p></a><h3>Funny Saturday quotes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/72e3749425e50098.jpg><p class=align-left>The weekend is largely associated with fun, relaxation, smiles, and laughter.

Have a great one!</li><li>Saturday and Sunday were sworn enemies until one day when they both decided to sit down and talk, and happy weekends were born.</li><li>It is the weekend. The toughest decision you will have to make is whether to have wine by the bottle or by the glass.</li><li>Middle age is when you’re sitting at home on a Saturday night and the telephone rings and you hope it isn’t for you. <i>– Ogden Nash</i></li><li>Saturday night is often seen as a time to try new things. Maybe that explains why so many people from the older generation lived for weekend nights.</li><li>I believe that it should be a mandatory law of the universe for everyone to do something fun on Saturdays.</li><li>It is the weekend. Sit back and relax. Even Robinson Crusoe had everything done by Friday!</li><li>Weekends and rainbows are alike in a way; they both look good from a distance but disappear when you get up close to them.</li><li>Nothing fades faster than the false hope that the weekend will not end fast.</li><li>I have this one theory about Saturday. If you do not wake up, eat, then go back to sleep, you are starting the weekend very wrongly.</li><li>Dear Saturday, what is it like knowing every other day of the week wishes it was you?</li><li>If you work eight-hour days, from Monday to Friday, then you have to keep the weekend sacred.</li><li>Better days are coming. They are called Saturday and Sunday.</li><li>There are not enough days in a weekend.</li><li>Beer, boxers, and batteries for the remote control; that is all a man needs to get through Saturday.</li><li>I imagine if the weekend was a snack, it would taste like salted caramel and chocolate.</li><li>When you are unemployed, weekends are seven days long.</li><li>Why is Monday so far away from the weekend and Saturday so close to Monday?</li><li>If you give a man a fish, he will have food for a day; If you teach the same man how to fish, you can get rid of him for the entire weekend.</li><li>Sometimes I sit back and wonder why the weekend was not made longer than the rest of the week.</li><li>Make a habit of getting up early on weekends. Why would you want to waste such precious time lying in bed?</li><li>The weekend is finally here, and you deserve a gift for getting through this week. May your weekend feel longer than the working days.</li><li>I am always eager to meet my best friend, and my best friend is the weekend.</li><li>Man, if only we had a day between Saturday and Sunday.</li><li>When you are young and energetic, make a point to live out every weekend.

So, be kind and give yourself and those things some rest.
