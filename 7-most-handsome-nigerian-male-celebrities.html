Tobi oozed sex appeal right there on the screen, and the ladies couldn't resist him.</p><p>From the handsome face, the toned body, the talent, the bag, everything is giving what it’s supposed to give. But ladies, better watch out, because Tobi is happily married with a kid.</p><p>With a series of successful movies to his name, Tobi shows no signs of stopping any time soon, and we are here for it!
