The view that life has no meaning goes up to 15% among religious Brits who don’t practice, and to four in ten (39%) among Britons who are not religious, while 45% of them think that it does.</p><p>How much does thinking about whether life has a meaning occupy Britons’ minds? For 15%, the answer is never. But 9% say they think about the meaning of life at least once a day, and a further 14% say a few times a week. Those aged 16-24 (31%) are more likely than older age groups (21-23%) to think about the meaning of life on at least a weekly basis.</p><p>Britons who practice their religion (45%) are twice as likely as those not practicing their religion (20%), and three times as likely as those who are not religious (16%), to say they think about the meaning of life several times a week.</p><h3>Have Britons lived a meaningful life?</h3><p>When asked directly if they think they have lived a meaningful life, six in ten (59%) Britons responded affirmatively, while (23%) said they had not.</p><p>While 73% of all Britons in the over-60s say they have had a meaningful life, younger age groups are less sure.</p><p>In the 16-24 age group, more men (48%) than women (41%) think they’ve lived a meaningful life. However, men between the ages of 25 and 59 (46-51%) are less likely than women in corresponding age groups (57-65%) to say their life has been meaningful.</p><p>Three quarters (77%) of those who are practicing their religion think they have lived a meaningful life, compared to 61% of those who aren’t practicing their religion and 53% of people who are not religious.</p><p>One in eight (13%) of those who say they practice their religion think they have not lived a meaningful life. The percentage doubles among those who are not practicing their religion (24%) or are not religious (27%).</p><p>Is life predetermined or do humans have free will?</p><p>A third of Britons (32%) think life is predetermined. This is made of 9% who think a person’s path in life is predetermined and can’t be changed, and 23% think that it can. Over half (56%) of Britons think life is not predetermined.</p><p>The belief in predestination of life is held by notably more British women (38%) than men (26%).</p><p>As many as 45% of those who are practicing their religion, and 27% of those who belong to a particular religion but are not practicing it, say that a person’s path in life is predetermined but that it can be changed. Another 16% of practicing believers believe that predestination can’t be changed, and this applies to 11% of those who are not practicing their religion.</p><p>By contrast, 72% of Britons who are not religious in any way state that the course of life is not predetermined. This view is shared by 29% of practicing believers, and 48% of non-practicing religious Britons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZ2iFdHnYqKygp6Zisaat06FkrKylmcZuucSapaKml2K5qrLE</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./11-ways-to-save-your-scratched-eye-glasses-you-might-have-wanted-to-throw-away-655110.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Ways to Save Your Scratched Eye Glasses You Might Have Wanted to Throw Away">&larr;
